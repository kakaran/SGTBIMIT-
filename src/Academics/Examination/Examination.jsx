          <h3>Mock Interview \Test Preparation</h3>
          <p>As with every skill you’ve ever learned, you have to learn the techniques and then practice, practice, practice. A mock interview is an indispensable tool in preparing for an actual interview, and, when done well, closely monitors what you could expect during your actual interview. However, a mock interview will only be as good as the participants make it. Do your best to recreate actual interview conditions by being as formal and professional as possible. The mock interviewer should stay in character throughout the interview and the interviewee must act as though s/he is in an actual interview. By preparing in advance of the interview, candidates can develop a stronger sense of self-confidence. Mock interviews can additionally uncover problems, mistakes or mishaps for the job seeker long before the actual interview occurs. In this way, the candidate is able to work to correct these issues during the practice period, and therefore elevate his or her performance during the actual interview.</p>

          <h2>SOME PREPARATION TIPS</h2>
          <p>Prepare for the session by researching your company/industry of interest. Investigate and identify the most common industry traits sought (analytical skills, communication skills, business knowledge and problem-solving). Script answers to demonstrate your experience with these factors as well as answers to behavioural interview questions, such as “Walk me through your resume”, “What made you choose to major in your Degree Program…..”, “What sort of position are you looking for”….? , “Where do you see yourself in two, five or ten years….”?</p>

          <h3>Human Resource (HR) Interview</h3>
          <p>HR Interviews can be a source of stress and anxiety when you are looking for a job. HR interview is your chance to make a good impression on your potential employer and ultimately, get the job. How you present yourself, what you wear, how you answer difficult questions and your general attitude all play key roles in HR interviews. All interviews are not the same and HR interviews are often times a screening process that can earn you a follow-up or selection interview within the company. If an individual passes the selection interview, he may be required to participate in a group interview for final analysis. The key to success in HR interviews is to be yourself while respecting your employer. Always highlight your strengths in HR interview and do not talk of weaknesses. Never show your faults, and never share regret with an interviewer.</p>

          <h3>Be prepared</h3>
          <p>Preparation boosts confidence. Practice with your friends or relatives. Read your resume before your interview. It will keep your answers fresh.</p>

          <h3>Be polite</h3>
          <p>Do not interrupt to the interviewer. Listen carefully to the questions being asked and then anticipate. If the interview is being conducted in a restaurant, mind your table manners. If the interviewers are serious and soft-spoken, then you should be same as the interviewee. Avoid loud laughter during the interview.</p>

          <h3>Be positive and smile</h3>
          <p>Keep in mind that there is only one chance to make a first impression. Every company wants employees who are goal-oriented, career-driven, enthusiastic and motivated. Be the employee as they want. End the interview on a positive note. The hiring official needs to know that you are interested, enthusiastic and excited about the position and the company.</p>

          <h3>Don’t discuss pay too early</h3>
          <p>Questions about pay in the first interview from anyone other than a temporary applicant are always bothersome. Unless the subject comes up, don’t wade into the issue of the pay in the first interview.</p>

          <h3>Talk technically to techies only</h3>
          <p>Feel free to discuss what you know, but remember: If you are talking to a nontechnical manager or human resources representative, you are not going to impress them with talk about life in the trenches. Answer questions about your education and work briefly and keep the tech comments to a minimum until you know the history of the company and the people involved in the hiring process. If you have questions about the technology in use at the site, keep your questions specific and relevant to the position for which you are applying.</p>

          <h3>Electronic interruption: Not welcomed</h3>
          <p>Cellular phone etiquette might seem a trivial thing, especially if the human resources representative has a low tolerance for personal digital devices. Store your electronic devices in pocket, purse, or briefcase in silent mode.</p>

          <h3>Remember to say thank you</h3>
          <p>Beyond thanking your interviewers for their time as you leave, it’s vital that you follow up in written form. If the competition for a position is tight, a follow-up thank you note can mean a lot. If the manager is slow to hire, the arrival of a thank-you note can serve as a reminder about the candidate who’s awaiting the manager’s next move. Just after you have completed the interview, take note of anything specific you discussed and make a point of referencing it in your thank you letter.</p>
